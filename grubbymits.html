          <cb_h2>World Tree<br></cb_h2>
          <cb_p>
          My latest attempt at working with procedurally generated worlds, but
          this time as a library. I learnt quite a bit from noisey-world and
          from Game Programming Patterns, so this project actually feels quite
          well organised after having some design go into it! I also finally
          took a look at TypeScript and I regret not doing so earlier!<br><br>
          It's by far the most feature rich project of mine, with the engine
          supporting geometry, collision detection and a light-weight event system
          that make it simple for users to quickly generate a world and plug
          characters into it. It currently supports 2D graphics, in an isometric
          perspective, but it's been designed so a different renderer can be used
          instead if it implements a couple of abstract methods. One nice little
          feature is that a user can provide the dimension ratios (WxDxH) of their
          isometric sprites and the engine will automatically create a simple box
          geometry for it. The engine also contains a simple world generator,
          which will try to generate as complex
          appearing world as possible with the given assets: it's possible to
          generate a world using just a single sprite, but the worlds look much
          better when having at least two so that walls and floors are better
          defined.<br><br>

          <cb_h2>Noisey World<br></cb_h2>
          <cb_p>
          Noisey World is a 2D island generator, written in Go, that uses a
	  <a href="https://github.com/ojrac/opensimplex-go">Perlin noise generator</a>
	  to create a height map and as the starting point for placing
	  rocks and trees. Moisture is added via a simple simulation of clouds
	  moving across the island, from a given direction. Most variables are
	  command line options and a good part of the generator is multi-threaded.
          I didn't port it to be a webapp, but pre-generated examples of the islands
          can be found <a href='noisey-world/noisey-islands.html'>here</a>.
	  <br><br>
          My first attempt at a procedurally generated was just some brute
          force thing that I created for Dungen. What I really wanted to do
          was to try to create a outside world - I find those types of games
          far more appealing. I quickly stumbled upon the procedural generation
          <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/proceduralgeneration/"> sub</a> and,
          like every other noob, got excited about Perlin noise.<br><br>
          I wanted to restrict myself to a 2D world and create something that
          looks something like the glorious British Isles: Scotland and Suffolk
          in particular... I took some resources from Kenney, made a load
          of modifications, and read through Amit Patel's
          <a href="https://www.redblobgames.com/maps/terrain-from-noise/">
          tutorial</a>. Making a 2D map with different 'heights' is something
  	  that I've never concerned myself with before. But I can remember the
	  joy of Zelda and Pokemon on the GameBoy - so the map is
	  constructed to look like those games: terraces where the character
	  would traverse them from the side facing the player.
          <br><br>
	  I quite like Go, for me it feels like scripting with C.
	  It was useful to have standard library for image manipulation and
	  though Go is designed for concurrency, it wasn't difficult to run
	  multiple threads across multiple cores simultaneously too. The
	  drawbacks, similar to C, are having to write boiler code for anything
	  algorithmic! Package management is also a bit odd... but it seems both
	  dependencies and generics are something that are being addressed. I
	  really don't understand how/why these were overlooked before. Or why
	  the official compiler doesn't make use of GCC or LLVM...<br><br>

          <cb_h2>Dungen<br></cb_h2>
          <cb_p>
          Dungen is an (abandoned) work in progress to create a 2D turn-based dungeon crawling
          fantasy RPG, written in Javascript. The player selects a character
          and then the area in which to play - with different areas that
          contain different types of enemy.
          There are multiple areas, with each area containing multiple levels
          which increase in difficulty.
          The player will build up a party of
          characters to defeat the dungeon, collecting loot from chests on the
          way. The equipment system is a bit of a mess though!
          The game engine is reasonably complete, but it's visuals are lacking.
          'stand out' features are procedurally generated maps, with local
          storage to save progress between sessions.
          The game has a basic battle and magic system, with different playable
          characters; though the enemy and NPC details need to be filled out -
	  they're pretty stupid and it's rather boring... But it can be played
          <a href='dungen/start.html'> here</a>!<br><br>
          I learnt a lot of playing with his project but ultimately couldn't be
          bothered to do the big re-writes that it needs. I also learnt that
          writing a, relatively, large program in Javascript is a bit of a pain.
          Typescript certainly interests me, but adding tooling to perform the
	  transpiling does not... being unshackled from those types of tools
	  was what got me interested in interweb programming in the first place!

          <cb_h2>Space Shooter<br></cb_h2>
          <cb_p>
          Space Shooter A simple shoot-up 'em that started as a project to teach da yoot
          Javascript. A simple game which partitions the screen in columns and
          injects enenmy spaceships into them, with only one ship per column.
          The enemy ships travel from the top of the screen to the bottom and
          randomly shoot lasers. The player controls a ship located at the
          bottom of the screen and has to prevent the enemy ships from passing
          it. All of the resources are by Kenney, linked below. It can be played
          <a href='space-shooter/play.html'> here</a>.
